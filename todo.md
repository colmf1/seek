### TODO:: 

Currently the nvim output isn't opening correctly 
- Could be due to filename that comes from LLM - it's been looking sus 
- Could be due to being unable to open correct file 


I also think I need to add support for different terminals, or at least add kitty to install.sh 

Eventually I'd like to be able to switch providers - but I'm not sure if zenity is the tool for that 

I'd also like it to work as a command line tool 
- Seek set changes provider
- Seek install runs install script
- Seek uninstall removes install script 


I also need to do something more smart about environment variables - I never seem to have any...
