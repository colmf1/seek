### TODO:: 

There's a lot we can do in uv 
I'll need 
- shell script to run it should be fine 
- cli app with typer
- need to compile into single binary with uv build 

Currently the nvim output isn't opening correctly 
- Could be due to filename that comes from LLM - it's been looking sus 
- Could be due to being unable to open correct file 
- Should be fixed by shell script 

- Seek set changes provider
- Seek install runs install script
- Seek uninstall removes install script
