## Plan for seek

- seek -q "Question" -  to be ran by hyprland wm and tests and nothing else 
- seek -set_provider "provider_name" - to set the provider for future queries
- seek -list_providers - to list all available providers
- seek -history - to show past queries and responses
- seek -set_sp - sets system prompt 

# Maybe 
- seek -update - git pull and installs without changing config dir
- seek -uninstall - idk testing??
